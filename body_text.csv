"Joseph Campbell once was quoted saying, “A hero is someone who has given his or her life to something bigger than oneself.” A hero can make a difference by his or her actions and words. A hero may live next door to you or can be someone who is known all around the world. There are many heroes that have accomplished a goal or great deed. A true hero has many qualities such as selflessness, perseverance, persistence, and open-mindedness. To some people, William Shakespeare of England is a hero because of his superior writing. William Shakespeare was born on April 23, 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon in England. He died on April 23, 1610. William was married to Mary Arden. They had three children named Susannah, Hamnet, and Judith. Although they didn’t follow in his footsteps, they admired and supported his work. William Shakespeare's wonderful plays have been performed all over the world. William wrote over 30 plays and 150 sonnets with very unique words in them. His works have been translated into every major language today. Shakespeare’s last two plays were written after he retired to Stratford. Many of Shakespeare’s plays have been known to be among the greatest in Western literature. He wrote tragedies, histories, comedies, and romances. Some of his plays are: A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Troilus and Cressida, As You Like It, and one of his most famous tragedies, Romeo and Juliet. These plays do not just fill hearts with joy, but they are plays that you can relate to no matter what your age is. Some represented real life problems. Shakespeare’s reputation has grown considerably since his own time. Not only is William a famous writer, he’s a hero too!"

"One day, Little Red Riding Hood’s mother said to her, “Take this basket of goodies to your grandma’s cottage, but don’t talk to strangers on the way!” Promising not to, Little Red Riding Hood skipped off. On her way she met the Big Bad Wolf who asked, “Where are you going, little girl?” “To my grandma’s, Mr. Wolf!” she answered. The Big Bad Wolf then ran to her grandmother’s cottage much before Little Red Riding Hood, and knocked on the door. When Grandma opened the door, he locked her up in the cupboard. The wicked wolf then wore Grandma’s clothes and lay on her bed, waiting for Little Red Riding Hood. When Little Red Riding Hood reached the cottage, she entered and went to Grandma’s bedside. “My! What big eyes you have, Grandma!” she said in surprise. “All the better to see you with, my dear!” replied the wolf. “My! What big ears you have, Grandma!” said Little Red Riding Hood. “All the better to hear you with, my dear!” said the wolf. “What big teeth you have, Grandma!” said Little Red Riding Hood. “All the better to eat you with!” growled the wolf pouncing on her. Little Red Riding Hood screamed and the woodcutters in the forest came running to the cottage. They beat the Big Bad Wolf and rescued Grandma from the cupboard. Grandma hugged Little Red Riding Hood with joy. The Big Bad Wolf ran away never to be seen again. Little Red Riding Hood had learnt her lesson and never spoke to strangers ever again."

"The crime rate in Chelsea is considerably higher than the national average across all communities in America from the largest to the smallest, although at 25 crimes per one thousand residents, it is not among the communities with the very highest crime rate. The chance of becoming a victim of either violent or property crime in Chelsea is 1 in 40. Based on FBI crime data, Chelsea is not one of the safest communities in America. Relative to Massachusetts, Chelsea has a crime rate that is higher than 93% of the state's cities and towns of all sizes. How does the crime rate in Chelsea compare to similar sized communities across America? When NeighborhoodScout compared Chelsea with other communities its size, we found that the crime rate was near the average for all other communities of similar size. So, whether Chelsea's crime rate is high or low compared to all places in the US, when we control for population size and compare it to places that are similar in size, it is near the middle of the pack in crime rate; not much more or less dangerous, and about what we would expect from the statistics. Now let us turn to take a look at how Chelsea does for violent crimes specifically, and then how it does for property crimes. This is important because the overall crime rate can be further illuminated by understanding if violent crime or property crimes (or both) are the major contributors to the general rate of crime in Chelsea. For Chelsea, we found that the violent crime rate is one of the highest in the nation, across communities of all sizes (both large and small). Violent offenses tracked included rape, murder and non-negligent manslaughter, armed robbery, and aggravated assault, including assault with a deadly weapon. According to NeighborhoodScout's analysis of FBI reported crime data, your chance of becoming a victim of one of these crimes in Chelsea is one in 123."
"This question originally appeared on Quora: What is the best way to answer a student who says, “Why are we learning this? We are never going to use geometry or Shakespeare in the real world?” I was watching an interview with a well-known actress a few years ago. She was opposing nuclear power, and made some statements about the aftermath of 3-Mile Island. After she went on for a while, the interviewer pointed out that she got many of her facts wrong. She was indignant. “This is not about facts,” she said. “It’s about feelings!” Many, maybe most people have a similar approach to life. There is a marvelous description of this attitude in the wonderful book, Uncommon Sense by Alan Cromer. Most of the world makes decisions based on feelings, not taking into account thoughtful analysis. Yet nothing conflicts with good decision making as much as giving in to this instinct. In my mind, Shakespeare and Geometry teach the most essential lessons needed for a productive and successful life. Properly taught, they teach you to think, to take in the evidence, to analyze, and to deduce. My favorite Shakespeare course was taught by Prof. Hugh Richmond at Berkeley; I went to all the lectures (as an auditor) and did the readings while I was a graduate student earning my Ph.D. in physics at Berkeley, but this course was very important to me. Whenever I see Prof. Richmond, I thank him yet again for this course. No course gave me more insight into human behavior. Or about writing and persuasion—Shakespeare’s methods for convincing us of his insights."
"Whales are a member of the cetacean family, and as such, despite being wholly water-resident, whales are mammals, not fish. There are only 83 species of cetaceans in the world organized into 14 families and two main subcategories: Toothed whales (Odontoceti, including killer whales, narwhals, dolphins, and porpoises) and baleen whales (Mysticeti, humpback whales, and rorquals). Toothed cetaceans have teeth and eat penguins, fish, and seals. Instead of teeth, Mysticeti have a shelf of bony material called baleen that filters tiny prey like zooplankton out of ocean water. All cetaceans, toothed or baleen, are mammals."

"Chelsea finally kept a clean sheet under Frank Lampard as the club great earned his first home win as manager with a 2-0 victory against Brighton on Saturday. Whereas, Tottenham overcame the 31st-minute sending-off of Serge Aurier and a bad mistake by goalkeeper Hugo Lloris to beat Southampton 2-1 in the Premier League. Jorginho converted a penalty after Mason Mount was tripped to give Chelsea a 50th-minute lead, and Willian's deflected shot in the 76th clinched all three points. It is the ninth straight league loss for Brighton against Chelsea an English record run for most games played, and lost, against one opponent. Brighton, which hit the crossbar late on through Dan Burns, hasn't won since the opening day of the season under its own new manager, Graham Potter. Lampard, who returned in the offseason to the team where he is the all-time top scorer, had seen Chelsea draw twice and lost the other of his first three home league games in charge at Stamford Bridge. ""We needed the win,"" Lampard said. ""We haven't had a 90-minute game where we've controlled it enough. The only disappointment is we didn't have more goals. A clean sheet as well. It is good for the confidence of everyone."" The Blues were good value for the win, having 17 shots in a one-sided first half during which Tammy Abraham headed against the post from Mount's free kick. Brighton somehow survived the first half, but conceded a penalty five minutes into the second when Adam Webster's poor touch in the area allowed Mount to poke the ball away from him. As the defender tried to win it back, he tripped Mount. advertisement Jorginho assumed penalty-taking duties, despite Pedro Rodriguez scoring one against Grimsby in the League Cup in midweek, and the Italy international coolly rolled it home. A short backpass almost gifted Abraham a second goal for Chelsea, but goalkeeper Mat Ryan was quickly off his line to snuff out the danger. It was 2-0 when Callum Hudson-Odoi, on as a substitute, fed Willian, who charged into the box and finished at the near post via a deflection. Tottenham overcomes red card, keeper error to win 2-1 Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has said it will take time to find unity in his squad after a turbulent offseason where several players either wanted to leave or thought they were leaving, but they showed signs of real team spirit in a rearguard effort. Tanguy Ndombele's goal put Spurs in front in the 24th minute but after Aurier was sent off for a second bookable offense, Lloris gifted Southampton a 39th-minute equalizer when he tried to turn striker Danny Ings near his own goalline."
